The mutual dynamics of irregularly shaped gravitating bodies is different from the regular two-body dynamics because of complex gravity interactions. This is often known as the Full-Two Body Problem (F2BP). Modeling the mutual dynamics usually requires extensive simulation burden.

To study dynamics of binary asteroid systems, I developed a [F2BP simulation package](/software). This model uses a linear Finite Element Model (FEM) shape function and does not require order truncation for the mutual gravity computation. (More details: [Yu et al., 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10569-019-9930-4))

Using this package, I have been studying asteroid (65803) Didymos system, which is a target asteroid for NASA's [DART](https://dart.jhuapl.edu/) mission. For example, combining the knowledge from [structural analysis](/research/structuralAnalysis), I am investigating how shape deformation of Didymos (primary) or Dimorphos (secondary) could affect the mutual dynamics.

Because FEM approaches are also used for other applications such as structural and [thermophysical](/research/thermophysicalModeling) analyses, this package can be combined with other FEM models to investigate complicated, coupled dynamical evolutions (e.g., [Binary-YORP effect](/research/BYORP)).
