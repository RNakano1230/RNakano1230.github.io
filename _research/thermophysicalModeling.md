When a surface is heated by the Sun, it reemits the energy as thermal radiation.
Photons convey momentum; thus, when they leave the surface, they impart a thermal
recoil force by momentum conservation.

Because small solar system bodies have shapes that are not symmetric,
the thermal recoil forces do not cancel and there will be a net force and torque.
This is the fundamental mechanism of the thermally-induced orbital and
spin state perturbations, known as the [Yarkovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarkovsky_effect)
and [YORP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarkovsky%E2%80%93O%27Keefe%E2%80%93Radzievskii%E2%80%93Paddack_effect)
effects, respectively. These effects play important roles in small bodies' formation
and evolution processes.

A proper thermophysical modeling is crucial in studying such thermally-induced effects.
We are thus developing a [thermophysical model](/Software) which solves 3-dimensional heat equation
via FEM (Finite Element Modeling) approach. We have been applying this model to
small bodies (e.g., Ryugu, Bennu, KY26) to study their thermal conditions
and resulting Yarkovsky and YORP effects.

This model is also suitable for studying thermal conditions of local topographic
features such as craters and boulders.
