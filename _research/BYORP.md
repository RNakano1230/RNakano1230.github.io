<!-- Binary asteroid systems account for a large fraction of near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population, about ~16%. Understanding the formation and evolution processes of binary asteroid systems are thus important in order to XXX.

The Binary-YORP (BYORP) is a process that a binary asteroid system experiences, where a net force by thermal imbalance alters the mutual orbit of the system. (This is an extension of the [Yarkovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarkovsky_effect) and [YORP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarkovsky%E2%80%93O%27Keefe%E2%80%93Radzievskii%E2%80%93Paddack_effect) effects.) The BYORP effect is of particular importance among other mechanisms, owing to its short timescale for mutual orbit expansion or contraction.

To investigate the BYORP effect with greater detail, we first develop a numerical model which accounts for the complex mutual dynamics and thermophysical evolution of a binary asteroid system. We combine a dynamics model ([F2BPFEM](/software)) and thermophysical model ([TPFEM](/software)). -->
