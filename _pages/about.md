I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Aerospace Engineering](https://eng.auburn.edu/aero/)
at [Auburn University](http://www.auburn.edu/).
I am affiliated with the [STAR Lab](http://eng.auburn.edu/~mzh0114/index.html)
led by Dr. Toshi Hirabayashi. I obtained my B.S. degree in Aerospace Engineering from
[The University of Alabama in Huntsville](https://www.uah.edu/) in 2019. I am currently a NASA [FINESST](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId={3E72ED7E-1FBD-F815-5A4E-2DA033EF7449}&path=open) fellow.

My current research looks at structural, thermophysical, and dynamical evolutions of
various objects in the Solar System -- from a few tens of meter small asteroids to
larger bodies such as the Moon. I am also working on NASA's first planetary defense mission, [DART](https://dart.jhuapl.edu/). My previous research includes development and testing of
electric propulsion devices for small satellites as well as modeling of
aerodynamics and flight dynamics of small flapping-wing vehicles for Mars exploration.


Research Interests
---
My research interests centered on the field of **planetary science** and **astrodynamics**,
and in particular, **formation** and **evolution** processes of **small bodies**
in the Solar System.

I have been establishing unique techniques to better understand small bodies'
**structural conditions** and **dynamical evolutions** due to, for example,
**shape deformation** or **thermal imbalance** (known as the
[Yarkovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarkovsky_effect) and
[YORP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarkovsky%E2%80%93O%27Keefe%E2%80%93Radzievskii%E2%80%93Paddack_effect) effects).
I also investigate **trajectory design** and **optimization** for interplanetary
**space exploration missions**.

_**Keywords**: Planetary science; Astrodynamics; Small bodies; Structural modeling;
Thermophysical modeling; Spacecraft Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&C);
Trajectory design; Optimization; Electric propulsion_
